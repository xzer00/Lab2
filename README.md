## Executive Summary 
In this lab, I am going to go over the different types of hardware, IEEE, data representation, and how everything pieces together. There are many things in the hardware world of information systems, including, but not limited to, hard drives and memory, and on the network side, latency and transfer rates, the different types of data storage, like solid state drives. Going into memory we will talk about Random Access Memory, or RAM. And I can't forget, the bare bones of hardware, where there is the ALU/Control Unit, and the brains, the CPU or processor. Logic Gates and the standards by IEEE.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
Hard drives are one of the first kinds of modern storage, and is still used widely today. It kind of runs like a record player, with a needle and disc spinning as it jumps back and forth reading, and writing data. The first use of these drives were in 1953 by IBM. With memory, we have multiple kinds running from RAM(Random Access Memory), NVRAM(Non-Volatile RAM), VRAM(Video RAM), ROM(Read Only Memory), DRAM(Dynamic RAM), SRAM(Static RAM), and more. The main things you need to know about memory and its types are what they do or behave. RAM is where instructions in the form of raw data are put through and gives the host instructions on what it needs to do, the more things that need processing, the higher amounts of RAM you'll need, and how fast the RAM is running depends on the speed you have in megahertz.
